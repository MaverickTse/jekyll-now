title: Last AviUtl English Documentation Effort
---

From time to time, people would wish me to support AviUtl again or write some article on it. Yet, for the last 4 years, I lost dearly to it.
Server cost, publishing cost and time. Worst still, local culture don't even bother my CV with AviUtl and works around it.

So for the LAST time I give this world a chance. I have setup a kickstarter project here:
[KS for AviUtl English Doc](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1093576740/comprehensive-english-documentation-for-aviutl)


Fundraising would end on 21 Jan 2018.

The target goal is a mere 3-month worth of salary. If such goal cannot be met, then please don't ask me to support it again. Nevertheless, current installer would work until Dropbox close its free service.
