# AviUtl
I would no longer work on AviUtl and OSS in general. The following list stuffs that would/may still work after I stopped supporting them:

* [SDK with English comment](https://github.com/MaverickTse/AviUtlSDK-EN)
* [Manual Tracking Plugin with CSV2EXO Python script](https://github.com/MaverickTse/AviUtlManualTracking)
* [Installer 1.14/Standalone 1.10](videohelp.com/software/AviUtl)

## L-SMASH Works binary
Get it from Avisynth page [HERE](avisynth.nl/index.php/LSMASHSource)

## A Warning to budding developers
Simply don't work on it. You would get _NOTHING_ except empty thanks. If you are paid, consider using Direct2D for a new software since most of the FX in exedit are GDI+ built-in effects.
