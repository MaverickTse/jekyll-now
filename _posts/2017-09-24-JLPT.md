# Views on JLPT Exam and misconceptions

Since I now passed JLPT N1 with score 147/180 in the 94.6% percentile ranking, I'm now in a better position to comment on it.

## Vocab types and size
There is NO such thing as "vocab size" for any level, and therefore it is unwise to depend on any single vocab list for any level. However, 
the easier levels (N4 N5) tend to test on words that are more concrete and close to daily life, such as 冷蔵庫、鉛筆　in Hiragana. In other words,
PRIMARY SCHOOL KIDS Vocab Level.

As level goes higher, the words tend to be more abstract, and in N1, it can be any Kanji and 外来語。So my advice is, instead of using a 
commercial word list book, read a lot and don't confine to certain genre. Personally I learn a boatload of vocab from Anime, AVG Games 
and light novels, but later I found that NHK's written materials are also excellent as learning materials.

## Archaic grammar
It is a misconception introduced by some famous Mock Exam compilation, while the actual official exam is NOT that archaic. There is another
 possibility that one may be skipping certain type of literature. The most odd-ball and hard-to-comprehend articles come from sorts of "reader digest",
 and 文庫 that is unpopular among younger generations. Mock exams often cite those materials making them insanely hard. Nowadays, the official JLPT
  often use material from actual news, or materials from NHK or Asahi, that is sane and "daily-life". Anyway, if you can handle those crazy
   mock exams, the actual JLPT should not be a big issue.
   
   
   Note that I'm not discouraging anyone from using those mock exam and grammar books, they are useful for training on the "phrase re-ordering"
    part and prepare you for unexpected challenges.
 
 ## Logic Skill Matters
 Your reading and comprehension ability in your Native Language MATTERS! If you sucks in school for Reading and Comprehension, you WILL be in trouble
  with the JLPT reading part, especially at higher levels. Conversely, if you are good at R&C, and you read a lot, the reading part should be
   straight forward and easier than mock papers.
   
 ## Techniques on doing Multiple-Choice-Questions
 1. Try to skim through and memorize the questions, and have a look at the source of the artice, before dwelling into the long passage
 2. Use elimination, before you have to guess
 3. Finish the easy parts first
 
 (P.S. If the article came from news, NHK or Asahi, it should be straight forward. If it comes from some unheard publication, be alerted)
 
 ## Score
 The average score for JLPT N1\~N3 is similar with average at 88 and stdev 30, meaning 95% people fall in the range 29\~147, with 30% pass rate.
 With full mark of 180, you SHOULD NOT aim for this average. To me, a consistent 30% pass rate is obscene for any public exam. This probably
  means a lot of people took this test without proper preparation, or their schools make them feel over-confident. N4 and N5 are ridiculously easy.
  With still only ~50% pass rate, meaning a significant portion of test-taker did not really study.
  
## No Pain No Gain
This this __THE__ motto of learning of my time, while gradually disbanded among schools after the millenia... what a pity.
To attain ANY skill to useful degree, hard work is _ESSENTIAL_, particularly for languages since


__Learning a language == Training a new conditional reflex__


You goal, should be aiming to be able _to think in the target language_. Failing to achieve this means you have not master the language yet.
